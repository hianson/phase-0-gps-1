**What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?**
Pulling repositories from GitHub onto my local repo, and then pushing them back to GitHub with the proper branch, as well as the Git workflow in general.

**What concepts were clarified during the GPS?**
The GPS has helped reinforce my understanding of the Git workflow, especially collaborating with others.

**What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?**
Are files considered untracked before doing git init, or after git init and before git add?
Do you need to use git init on a local repository even though you've initialized a repository on GitHub?

**What still confuses you about Git?**

Do you need to merge a feature branch to your own local repository after pushing the feature branch to GitHub?

**How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?**
My first experience with Kristin was very comfortable and she gave me a lot of space as a driver to both learn from doing, and learn from asking questions. Watching someone enter commands into the terminal is a very different experience from doing it yourself, and being able to communicate what you are doing as a driver is a totally new skill which I realized I was lacking.
