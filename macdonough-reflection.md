* What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

Push/pull requests, when to create new directories and initialize them, and the relationship between merging files from different local sources.

* What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

Creating new directories on Github and locally, and when to initialize each. If we were creating a new repository on Github and selecting the "Include README.md" tab, I thought we didn't have to initialize a directory locally because we would be cloning it. This was clarified during the pairing session.

Walking through a push and pull request with another person rather than merging my own push in my own repository gave me a better idea of how it will be working with a team.

* What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

About when to initialize folders.

* What still confuses you about Git?

My pair and I are both a little confused about when to merge a local branch to the local master - before or after the branch is pushed to Github?

* How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Great. It really helps to talk out concepts and work through the releases with someone. Anson was great to work with and really easy to communicate with. It was also helpful to have a guide who was hands-off; he was available when we had questions but it didn't feel like he was hovering (virtually).
